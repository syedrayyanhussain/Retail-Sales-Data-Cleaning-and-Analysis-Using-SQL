-- Retail Sales Data Cleaning and Analysis
-- =======================================

-- 1. Load the Sales Data
SELECT * FROM store.sales;


-- 2. Remove Duplicates
-- --------------------
SELECT transaction_id, COUNT(*)
FROM sales
GROUP BY transaction_id
HAVING COUNT(*) = 2;

WITH cte AS (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY transaction_id ORDER BY transaction_id) AS Row_Num
    FROM sales
)
DELETE FROM sales
WHERE transaction_id IN (
    SELECT transaction_id
    FROM cte
    WHERE Row_Num = 2
);


-- 3. Correct Column Names
-- -----------------------
ALTER TABLE sales CHANGE quantiy quantity INT;
ALTER TABLE sales CHANGE prce price INT;


-- 4. Convert Purchase Date to Proper Date Format
-- ----------------------------------------------
ALTER TABLE sales ADD purchase_date_temp DATE;

UPDATE sales
SET purchase_date_temp = STR_TO_DATE(purchase_date, '%d/%m/%Y');

ALTER TABLE sales DROP COLUMN purchase_date;
ALTER TABLE sales CHANGE purchase_date_temp purchase_date DATE;


-- 5. Check for Null or Empty Fields
-- ---------------------------------
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE transaction_id IS NULL OR transaction_id = ''
   OR customer_id IS NULL OR customer_id = ''
   OR customer_age IS NULL
   OR gender IS NULL OR gender = ''
   OR product_id IS NULL OR product_id = ''
   OR product_category IS NULL OR product_category = ''
   OR quantity IS NULL
   OR price IS NULL
   OR payment_mode IS NULL OR payment_mode = ''
   OR time_of_purchase IS NULL
   OR `status` IS NULL OR `status` = ''
   OR purchase_date IS NULL;


-- 6. Fix Missing Customer IDs
-- ---------------------------
UPDATE sales SET customer_id = 'CUST9494' WHERE transaction_id = 'TXN977900';
UPDATE sales SET customer_id = 'CUST1401' WHERE transaction_id = 'TXN985663';


-- 7. Normalize Gender and Payment Mode
-- ------------------------------------
UPDATE sales SET gender = 'Female' WHERE gender = 'F';
UPDATE sales SET gender = 'Male' WHERE gender = 'M';

UPDATE sales SET payment_mode = 'Credit Card' WHERE payment_mode = 'CC';
